MedCare Website
-----------------------------------------------------

This is a simple part of my graduation project that shows my <b>HTML</b>, <b>CSS</b>, <b>JavaScript</b>, <b>Media Query</b> and <b>JQuery</b> skills.

*   Just clone the repo and open <u>index.html</u> file to see the live website.
*   Screenshots can be found in <b>/screenshots</b> folder.
*   This project was originally built in the mid of 2021.
